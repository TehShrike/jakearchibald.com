Back on May 29th I did a 100km walk from London to Brighton in support of [Cancer Research](https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/), which seems forever ago, but turns out it takes _a long time_ to get donation money out of corporations. But hey, it's all there now, and the final total is:

Â£20,864

I'm incredibly proud of this, but to be fair, I just had a nice (but lengthy) walk around. It's the folks who donated that made that number happen. Whether you donated or encouraged me on Twitter, I can't thank you enough.

A big shout out to Google, who matched a chunk of the donations. Â£7,510 of the total is from them. But also thanks to GitHub! I stumbled across a GitHub security bug while I was training for the walk, and that 'won' me $2,000. Since it was a lucky find, it seemed right to throw that in the pot, and since it was going to charity, GitHub threw in another $2,000, so Â£2,864 of the total is from them. Cheers!

During the walk I did 19 live AMA sessions. Some were a bit of a mess due to connectivity issues, but they kept me awake! Here they are, along with some pictures and tweets from the day.

This was originally going to go at the start of an episode of HTTP 203, but the team that manages our YouTube channel said it wasn't clear this was "anti-cancer". I'll let you be the judge ðŸ™ƒ

# Bake-dancing

Donations came in faster than I expected, so I created a 'reward' for reaching Â£5,000.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We&#39;re past Â£5,000! Mixed feelings about this one. I mean, I&#39;m delighted folks have donated so much, but on the other hand, this is out there now: <a href="https://t.co/2yPboZd7XA">pic.twitter.com/2yPboZd7XA</a></p>&mdash; Jake Archibald (@jaffathecake) <a href="https://twitter.com/jaffathecake/status/1371754248568979457?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 16, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Mostly me stressing about my knee which thankfully didn't turn out to be an issue. I also seem to be bragging about having 3 pints. What a madman.

# Panicking at the start line

For a while it looked like Google _wasn't_ going to do the donation matching. Here's what happened.

# Getting started

Some great footage of me in a queue, which really sets the bar for the day's content, but also a bit on why I chose Cancer Research UK as the charity to support.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Guess it&#39;s just that 19 more times <a href="https://t.co/2kslSS9KkO">pic.twitter.com/2kslSS9KkO</a></p>&mdash; Jake Archibald (@jaffathecake) <a href="https://twitter.com/jaffathecake/status/1398537242679853058?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 29, 2021</a></blockquote>

# Hour 3: We got lost

<figure class="full-figure max-figure">
<div class="video"><iframe name="hour-3" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hMJoTkIbygU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
</figure>

[Jecelyn Yeen](https://twitter.com/JecelynYeen) asks me about my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hMJoTkIbygU?start=197&autoplay=1" target="hour-3">Mark Zuckerberg hairstyle</a>, but I think the big moment is when I realised we'd <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hMJoTkIbygU?start=301&autoplay=1" target="hour-3">taken a wrong turn</a>. So, err, it turned out to be about a 103km walk in the end.

# Hour 4: Tech stacks and fast cars

<figure class="full-figure max-figure">
<div class="video"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-S3gj8K_uHc" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
</figure>

[Jack Franklin](https://twitter.com/Jack_Franklin) asks me what tech stack I'd choose to build the Ferrari website (after I [dissected their current site](https://jakearchibald.com/2021/f1-perf-part-6/)).

# Hour 5: Poo, sick, and underwear. It's the Archibald special!

Turns out this area of London has a thing for decorating post boxes:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">There&#39;s more! <a href="https://t.co/Sps7Tx6fjB">pic.twitter.com/Sps7Tx6fjB</a></p>&mdash; Jake Archibald (@jaffathecake) <a href="https://twitter.com/jaffathecake/status/1398575977064767489?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 29, 2021</a></blockquote>

Then I jumped on a call with _my family_:

<figure class="full-figure max-figure">
<div class="video"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1NteSACjX3o" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
</figure>

And because it's my family, we talk about poo, underwear, cats, how I once broke BBC i-player, how I nearly burned the UK Google office down, and my dad reminds me of the time I vom'd in his desk drawer.

# Hour 6: What a mess

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">So I guess it&#39;s just that but 4 more times <a href="https://t.co/pf9a5hGcmF">pic.twitter.com/pf9a5hGcmF</a></p>&mdash; Jake Archibald (@jaffathecake) <a href="https://twitter.com/jaffathecake/status/1398589659421327362?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 29, 2021</a></blockquote>

Then I jumped on a call with [Surma](https://twitter.com/DasSurma):

<figure class="full-figure max-figure">
<div class="video"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QaP50brumvg" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
</figure>

This 'episode' is a disaster due to connectivity issues, so I include it mostly for completeness, although Surma does a stellar job filling. In fact, I'm watching it for the first time myself.

# Hour 7: Spicy crisps, batteries, and changing the web

<figure class="full-figure max-figure">
<div class="video"><iframe name="hour-7" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ft8TdeEIH6o" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
</figure>

This time I found some 5g, and things went much better. Surma asks me <a target="hour-7" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ft8TdeEIH6o?start=340&autoplay=1">what I'd change about the web if I had total authority</a>, and the answer is CORS, it's always CORSâ€¦ but also URLs.

Also, watching this back, why am I walking around in circles? What a waste of energy.

# Hour 8: Someone who actually knows what they're talking about

<figure class="full-figure max-figure">
<div class="video"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cH9ukbu-2po" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
</figure>

In this one, we were joined by [Dr Alice](https://twitter.com/AliceEmmaLouise), a real cancer researcher, and also a host of the [Skeptics with a K](http://www.merseysideskeptics.org.uk/podcasts/) podcast which I thoroughly recommend.

I was really stressed about this one given the connection issues I'd already had; I really didn't want to waste Alice's time. But it all went well! A huge thanks to Dr Alice for bringing some actual knowledge to the proceedings.

# Hour 9: Zombie apocalypses (apocali?)

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I guess it&#39;s that another 2.33333333 times (if my maths is right, brain not working) <a href="https://t.co/IKaIGld32W">pic.twitter.com/IKaIGld32W</a></p>&mdash; Jake Archibald (@jaffathecake) <a href="https://twitter.com/jaffathecake/status/1398638765627875334?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 29, 2021</a></blockquote>

Then I chatted to the one and only [Paul Lewis](https://twitter.com/aerotwist).

<figure class="full-figure max-figure">
<div class="video"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cVXxWSNBcys" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
</figure>

This is a nice silly one. Just what I needed. I'll happily chat for hours about zombies.

# Hour 10: Remember Flash?

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Definitely not in London now <a href="https://t.co/knZeYm6WYQ">pic.twitter.com/knZeYm6WYQ</a></p>&mdash; Jake Archibald (@jaffathecake) <a href="https://twitter.com/jaffathecake/status/1398652360134696966?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 29, 2021</a></blockquote>

Then I chatted _both Paul and Surma_!

<figure class="full-figure max-figure">
<div class="video"><iframe name="hour-10" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xz4TWpN23Nc" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
</figure>

Some connection issues at the start of this, so you might want to <a target="hour-10" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xz4TWpN23Nc?autoplay=1&start=137">skip to 2:17</a>, where I'm answering "What would you do if you weren't at Google?" We all chat about why we do what we do, and reminisce about Flash (both Paul and I started out as Flash developers).

# Hour 11: Standards, appcache, and sheep go baa

<figure class="full-figure max-figure">
<div class="video"><iframe name="hour-11" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/p5PFcoNfbdw" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
</figure>

This time me and Surma are joined by Maud Nalpas. If you want to skip to the AMA question, it's at <a target="hour-11" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/p5PFcoNfbdw?autoplay=1&start=296">4:56</a>, "how did you get involved in browser standards?"

[Here's the 'contributing to web standards' HTTP 203 episode we refer to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1TEPQz02iU).

We also did another question at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/p5PFcoNfbdw?autoplay=1&start=959" target="hour-11">15:59</a>, "what advice would you give to students starting out in web development?"

# Hour 12: That new sock feeling, and number puzzles

<figure class="full-figure max-figure">
<div class="video"><iframe name="hour-12" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hiAiMmcbC6Q" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
</figure>

This time I'm joined by [Phil Hawksworth](https://twitter.com/philhawksworth). A highlight is an <a target="hour-12" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hiAiMmcbC6Q?autoplay=1&start=235">interesting maths puzzle</a> that Phil presents me with, then we chat about the <a target="hour-12" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hiAiMmcbC6Q?autoplay=1&start=499">best conference talks we've seen</a>.

# Hour 13: Another disaster

<figure class="full-figure max-figure">
<div class="video"><iframe name="hour-13" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZttXQLW93-k" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
</figure>

Oof, this one is one big connection issue. I'll leave it here for completeness, and to show how well Phil coped with it.

# Hour 14: Suncream, tiredness, and Beat Saber

<figure class="full-figure max-figure">
<div class="video"><iframe name="hour-14" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fH_0o8jZnhs" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
</figure>

This time it's [Mariko's](https://twitter.com/kosamari) turn to join me, and whoa, I'm starting to sound really tired. There are a few connection issues with this one, but it seems to sort itself out in time for the question <a target="hour-14" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fH_0o8jZnhs?autoplay=1&start=315">"what do you do day to day as a dev rel?"</a>. And then it features a <a target="hour-14" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fH_0o8jZnhs?autoplay=1&start=626">live crossing of the half way mark</a>!

Seeing how much happier I am at the end of this video vs the start makes me realise how much doing these videos _helped_. A huge thanks to everyone who joined me on these calls.

# Hour 15: The Proclaimers, love-hating Star Trek, and toilet chat again

<figure class="full-figure max-figure">
<div class="video"><iframe name="hour-15" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TGEfryVZ5vk" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
</figure>

I'm joined by [Paul Kinlan](https://twitter.com/Paul_Kinlan) who tries to do a joke/maths. Eventually we get onto the important questions, which since Paul picked them, are all toilet-based, starting with <a target="hour-15" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TGEfryVZ5vk?autoplay=1&start=422">"what do you do if you need a poo and there's no toilet?"</a>.

# Hour 16: Curry and my best friend array.reduce

<figure class="full-figure max-figure">
<div class="video"><iframe name="hour-16" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jbxd5iXVsJ4" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
</figure>

It's Mariko again! We talk about <a target="hour-16" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jbxd5iXVsJ4?autoplay=1&start=70">food options</a>, I <a target="hour-16" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jbxd5iXVsJ4?autoplay=1&start=106">reminisce about a diet coke I had earlier and lament that there's been none since</a>, then Mariko drops a tech question, <a target="hour-16" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jbxd5iXVsJ4?autoplay=1&start=278">"if you have to walk 100km every week, or use `array.reduce` every day, which do you choose?"</a>. I'm sorry to say, rather than answer the question, I just went on a massive rant about `array.reduce` and "smart code".

As if by magic, the food that Mariko recommended turned up!

# Hour 17: Night of the living chuckle sisters

<figure class="full-figure max-figure">
<div class="video"><iframe name="hour-17" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-enYw2mY48g" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
</figure>

By this point I'd ran out of friends to jump on the calls, so it was left to the chuckle sisters [Frances](https://twitter.com/phae) and [Monica](https://twitter.com/notwaldorf) to handle the _next six calls_.

I mentioned that I had a curry, which lead to Frances and Monica throwing down an impromptu AMA question, <a target="hour-17" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-enYw2mY48g?autoplay=1&start=58">"would you rather never poo again or poo continually forever"</a>. That's it. That's the tone for the rest of the calls.

The previous diet coke story <a target="hour-17" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-enYw2mY48g?autoplay=1&start=204">reaches a happy conclusion</a>, which leads onto the next 'real' AMA question, not about poo, <a target="hour-17" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-enYw2mY48g?autoplay=1&start=257">"what snacks have you taken?"</a>.

The chuckle sisters take the piss by asking yet another question, <a target="hour-17" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-enYw2mY48g?autoplay=1&start=488">"what animals have you observed on the route?"</a>, and the answer is very dull. Oh, and [here's the Mitchel and Webb sketch we chat about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjIeA5CLiNk).

Then, it was time to get moving again.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Bring on the night <a href="https://t.co/XocDcvvFQu">pic.twitter.com/XocDcvvFQu</a></p>&mdash; Jake Archibald (@jaffathecake) <a href="https://twitter.com/jaffathecake/status/1398770280928063490?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 29, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

# Hour 18: Impressions, faux pas, and quadra-nipples

<figure class="full-figure max-figure">
<div class="video"><iframe name="hour-18" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LkS-XOaUgdE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
</figure>

I try to paint a picture of what it's like walking at night, then Monica dives in with the next question <a target="hour-18" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LkS-XOaUgdE?autoplay=1&start=90">"what's the most useless talent you have?"</a>, and I reveal an impression I can do, that I describe as "passable". Then I chat a bit about the <a target="hour-18" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LkS-XOaUgdE?autoplay=1&start=227">over-the-top head torch I'm wearing</a>.

Oh and Frances mentions that [Alex Russell](https://twitter.com/slightlylate) is next to her, who I knew was leaving Google. Anyway, I start to mention that, then realised it wasn't public knowledge yet, so <a target="hour-18" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LkS-XOaUgdE?autoplay=1&start=307">spectacularly back out of mentioning it</a> ðŸ˜¬.

We dive into another question <a target="hour-18" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LkS-XOaUgdE?autoplay=1&start=496">"how often are you bothered by a wild Surma?"</a>, and naturally we move on to <a target="hour-18" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LkS-XOaUgdE?autoplay=1&start=747">Harry Styles and his quadra-nipples</a>.

# Hour 19: Pain, mud, and university

<figure class="full-figure max-figure">
<div class="video"><iframe name="hour-19" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZkgqLLncBNY" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
</figure>

This chat starts with back pain, but also a rucksack itinerary, then moves onto the secret weapon I bought to handle muddiness. I recall a time <a target="hour-19" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZkgqLLncBNY?autoplay=1&start=397">I bought Alex a bright blue cocktail</a> and he was not amused. Eventually we get onto the question, which is <a target="hour-19" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZkgqLLncBNY?autoplay=1&start=496">"do you need a degree to work on the web?"</a>, and chat about whether is it's better to start off learning the high level or low level. We also reminisce about [Dave Shea's](https://twitter.com/mezzoblue) [CSS zen garden](http://www.csszengarden.com/).

# Hour 20: Hair, counting, and movies

<figure class="full-figure max-figure">
<div class="video"><iframe name="hour-20" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lsee1sYhyYQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
</figure>

In an incredible _twist to the format_, I ask Monica how to pronounce "Ardingly", which is a local village. The chuckle sisters are not impressed that I'm messing with the format. I get a question from a 5 year old, and it's <a target="hour-20" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lsee1sYhyYQ?autoplay=1&start=209">"What is your hair colour, and which hair colour would walk the fastest?"</a>. We also chat about the genre of music Frances and I are obsessed with, <a target="hour-20" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lsee1sYhyYQ?autoplay=1&start=377">songs with counting in them</a>. Then we get to the actual question <a target="hour-20" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lsee1sYhyYQ?autoplay=1&start=546">"what's your most unpopular opinion?"</a> but we end up just talking about movie. At some point I mention Jon Pertwee but I mean Sean Pertwee. Look, I'm tired.

# Hour 21: Podcasts, Glow, and test articles

<figure class="full-figure max-figure">
<div class="video"><iframe name="hour-21" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-dk3J-_KkwU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
</figure>

We jump straight into chatting about chocolate. We chat a bit about podcasts we like, which are:

- [All Killa No Filla](https://allkillanofilla.libsyn.com/), an excellent podcast by a couple of comedians who have a shared interest in the history of serial killers.
- [Skeptics with a K](http://www.merseysideskeptics.org.uk/podcasts/), the science podcast mentioned earlier.
- [The Taskmaster podcast](https://taskmaster.tv/podcast), which is a companion to the excellent TV show.
- [The Adam Buxton podcast](https://www.adam-buxton.co.uk/podcasts), which is an interview series.
- [The comedian's comedian](https://www.comedianscomedian.com/), a series which interviews comedians on how they write and perform.
- [Off the menu](https://www.offmenupodcast.co.uk/), a comedy podcast about food.

Then we get onto actual question, <a target="hour-21" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-dk3J-_KkwU?autoplay=1&start=451">"when will Glow 2.0 be released?"</a> which is someone trolling about a JavaScript I worked on over 10 years ago. If you want to dive into history, [here are the docs](https://www.bbc.co.uk/glow/).

I tell the story of <a target="hour-21" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-dk3J-_KkwU?autoplay=1&start=796">fake Steve</a>. Here are [the photos](https://photos.app.goo.gl/DhMggvgq4eoV4oYZ8). Then I get all of the connection difficulties, while the chuckle sisters do a great job of filling by talking about Taskmaster.

# Hour 22: "Aggressive triangle tits"

The final AMA. The sun is rising again. Sorry my volume is low on this one, my phone was as tired as I was and refused to connect properly to my earphones.

Just to reiterate what I said in the video, thank you to all the folks who took time to chat to me on these episodes, particularly Frances and Monica who did 6 of them.
