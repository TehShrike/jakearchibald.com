Back on May 29th I did a 100km walk from London to Brighton in support of [Cancer Research](https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/), which seems forever ago, but turns out it takes _a long time_ to get donation money out of corporations. But hey, it's all there now, and the final total is:

Â£20,864

I'm incredibly proud of this, but to be fair, I just had a nice (but lengthy) walk around. It's the folks who donated that made that number happen. Whether you donated or encouraged me on Twitter, I can't thank you enough.

A big shout out to Google, who matched a chunk of the donations. Â£7,510 of the total is from them. But also thanks to GitHub! I stumbled across a GitHub security bug while I was training for the walk, and that 'won' me $2,000. Since it was a lucky find, it seemed right to throw that in the pot, and since it was going to charity, GitHub threw in another $2,000, so Â£2,864 of the total is from them. Cheers!

During the walk I did 19 live AMA sessions. Some were a bit of a mess due to connectivity issues, but they kept me awake! Here they are, along with some pictures and tweets from the day.

This was originally going to go at the start of an episode of HTTP 203, but the team that manages our YouTube channel said it wasn't clear this was "anti-cancer". I'll let you be the judge ðŸ™ƒ

# Bake-dancing

Donations came in faster than I expected, so I created a 'reward' for reaching Â£5,000.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We&#39;re past Â£5,000! Mixed feelings about this one. I mean, I&#39;m delighted folks have donated so much, but on the other hand, this is out there now: <a href="https://t.co/2yPboZd7XA">pic.twitter.com/2yPboZd7XA</a></p>&mdash; Jake Archibald (@jaffathecake) <a href="https://twitter.com/jaffathecake/status/1371754248568979457?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 16, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

# Panicking in the hotel

Mostly me stressing about my knee which thankfully didn't turn out to be an issue. I also seem to be bragging about having 3 pints. What a madman.

# Panicking at the start line

For a while it looked like Google _wasn't_ going to do the donation matching. Here's what happened.

# Getting started

Some great footage of me in a queue, which really sets the bar for the day's content, but also a bit on why I chose Cancer Research UK as the charity to support.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Guess it&#39;s just that 19 more times <a href="https://t.co/2kslSS9KkO">pic.twitter.com/2kslSS9KkO</a></p>&mdash; Jake Archibald (@jaffathecake) <a href="https://twitter.com/jaffathecake/status/1398537242679853058?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 29, 2021</a></blockquote>

# Hour 3: We got lost

<div class="video"><iframe name="hour-3" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hMJoTkIbygU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

[Jecelyn Yeen](https://twitter.com/JecelynYeen) asks me about my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hMJoTkIbygU?start=197&autoplay=1" target="hour-3">Mark Zuckerberg hairstyle</a>, but I think the big moment is when I realised we'd <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hMJoTkIbygU?start=301&autoplay=1" target="hour-3">taken a wrong turn</a>. So, err, it turned out to be about a 103km walk in the end.

# Hour 4: Tech stacks and fast cars

<figure class="full-figure max-figure">
<div class="video"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-S3gj8K_uHc" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
</figure>

[Jack Franklin](https://twitter.com/Jack_Franklin) asks me what tech stack I'd choose to build the Ferrari website (after I [dissected their current site](https://jakearchibald.com/2021/f1-perf-part-6/)).

# Hour 5: Poo, sick, and underwear. It's the Archibald special!

Turns out this area of London has a thing for decorating post boxes:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">There&#39;s more! <a href="https://t.co/Sps7Tx6fjB">pic.twitter.com/Sps7Tx6fjB</a></p>&mdash; Jake Archibald (@jaffathecake) <a href="https://twitter.com/jaffathecake/status/1398575977064767489?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 29, 2021</a></blockquote>

Then I jumped on a call with _my family_:

<figure class="full-figure max-figure">
<div class="video"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1NteSACjX3o" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
</figure>

And because it's my family, we talk about poo, underwear, cats, how I once broke BBC i-player, how I nearly burned the UK Google office down, and my dad reminds me of the time I vom'd in his desk drawer.

# Hour 6: What a mess

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">So I guess it&#39;s just that but 4 more times <a href="https://t.co/pf9a5hGcmF">pic.twitter.com/pf9a5hGcmF</a></p>&mdash; Jake Archibald (@jaffathecake) <a href="https://twitter.com/jaffathecake/status/1398589659421327362?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 29, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Then I jumped on a call with [Surma](https://twitter.com/DasSurma):

<figure class="full-figure max-figure">
<div class="video"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QaP50brumvg" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
</figure>

This 'episode' is a disaster due to connectivity issues, so I include it mostly for completeness, although Surma does a stellar job filling. In fact, I'm writing this watching it for the first time myself.

# Hour 7: Spicy crisps, batteries, and changing the web

<figure class="full-figure max-figure">
<div class="video"><iframe name="hour-7" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ft8TdeEIH6o" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
</figure>

This time I found some 5g, and things went much better. Surma asks me <a target="hour-7" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ft8TdeEIH6o?start=340&autoplay=1">what I'd change about the web if I had total authority</a>, and the answer is 'CORS', but also URLs.

Also, watching this back, why am I walking around in circles? What a waste of energy.
