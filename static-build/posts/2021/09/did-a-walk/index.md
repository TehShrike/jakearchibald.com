Back on May 29th I did a 100km walk from London to Brighton in support of [Cancer Research](https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/), which seems forever ago, but turns out it takes _a long time_ to get donation money out of corporations. But hey, it's all there now, and the final total is:

£20,864

I'm incredibly proud of this, but to be fair, I just had a nice (but lengthy) walk around. It's the folks who donated that made that number happen. Whether you donated or encouraged me on Twitter, I can't thank you enough.

A big shout out to Google, who matched a chunk of the donations. £7,510 of the total is from them. But also thanks to GitHub. I stumbled across a GitHub security bug while I was training for the walk, and that 'won' me $2,000. Since it was a lucky find, it seemed right to throw that in the pot, and since it was going to charity, GitHub threw in another $2,000, so £2,864 of the total is from them. Cheers!

# Videos

During the walk I did 19 live AMA sessions. Some were a bit of a mess due to connectivity issues, but they kept me awake! Here they are, along with a couple of other videos I posted along the way:
